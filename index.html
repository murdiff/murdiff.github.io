<h1>Definitely not prepared for visitors</h1>
<p>Oh, wow, hi. If I've told you about this webpage, well, here she is. 
  <br>If you somehow managed to find this random webiste, congradulations on spending way too much time on the internet. 
  <br>Regardless, I hope you'll visit this website periodically to see how it progresses.
  <br>I'm completely new to this whole <em>website thing</em>. I basically just said "Hey buying a domain sounds fun!"
  <br>And so here we are. Another aimless website taking up space and now, evidently, your time.
  <br><br>
  Cheers.</p>
